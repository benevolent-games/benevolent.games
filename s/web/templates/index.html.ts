			<h2>community-powered games</h2>
			<p>we're all growing tired of the greed and corporatism of the modern gaming industry. <em>let's make something different.</em></p>
			<p>here at benevolent games, we're working hard to reinvent game development.</p>
			<p><strong>humanoid</strong> is our first prototype project. it's a sandbox where we can experiment with new game ideas. we just got started, so it's seriously not playable yet, we're just assembling the basics.. but we make progress every week ;)</p>

				<h3>🌎 run on any device</h3>
				<h4>let's invite everyone to play.</h4>
				<p>laptops, desktops, phones, and even vr. we develop games for the web, so installations aren't necessary.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>📖 be open source</h3>
				<h4>mit licensed.</h4>
				<p>anybody can freely contribute, use our code and art, fork our games, and make their own new games. let's blur the lines between developers, modders, and the community.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>😇 involve the community</h3>
				<h4>games don't need secrecy or nda's.</h4>
				<p>join the developers for weekly play-testing sessions, participate in discussions about new ideas, and report bugs directly to our github issues page.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>💸 be funded by donations</h3>
				<h4>what goes around comes around.</h4>
				<p>we believe that if developers act with benevolence and generosity towards gamers, the community just might return the favor.</p>
